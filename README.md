# Front-end web development Projects

Here are some sample websites that I made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

* [Space Station Site](https://github.com/mrmuratinan/MyRepository/tree/main/HTML-CSS-Projects/the-space-station-site)
* [Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/mrmuratinan/MyRepository/tree/main/HTML-CSS-Projects/movie-theater-site)

## Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a imaginary Space travel company. It contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

## Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Boostrap 4. It
contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns
